# Racket: variant of Scheme Programming Language

Lisp family of programming languages.

## Overview

Code stored in `.rkt` files and output in the `.md` files.

The interactive terminal experiments are also shown in `.md` files, particularly for commented out code in `.rkt` files.

## Notes

*Found out about "berkeley_cs61a_spring-2011_archive" later on, now using simply-scheme instead of pure racket.
